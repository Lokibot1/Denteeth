# Denteeth

Our last project way back 1st year 2nd sem on Systems Analysis and Design, I didn't really coded much here and I just tried to help around with the development since my role is "Business Analyst" in this project.

Originally developed with https://github.com/xionnnnn as our full-stack dev and https://github.com/jsjs2324 as our lead frontend dev.

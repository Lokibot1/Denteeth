  <h1>DENTURES</h1>

  <p>Removable prosthetic devices called dentures are used to replace lost teeth and improve
  oral health. Complete dentures, which replace every tooth in an arch, and partial
  dentures, which cover gaps left by residual natural teeth, are the two primary varieties.
  Dentures support speech, chewing, and the preservation of facial structure. They are
  made of materials such as acrylic resin or a combination of acrylic and metal. Because
  they are crafted specifically to match each person's mouth's curves, they usually need to
  be adjusted on a regular basis to maintain comfort and functionality.</p>
